    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "abs\n",
    "print\n",
    "type\n",
    "```\n",
    "And functions from other packages, like `sin`/`cos`/`tan` from the `math` package. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you use them, you have to provide inputs (*arguments*), and save some sort of output, like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = -5\n",
    "x2 = abs(x)\n",
    "print x2\n",

    "These functions are not very special. There are just bits of python code that some other person wrote. Some of them are provided with standard Python, others are included in packages. But remember, they are all written by people, there is nothing magical about them. \n",

    "That means that *you* can write your own functions too! I encourage you to do this, because it makes your code much more readable, and most of the time it makes your code more efficient. \n",

    "### Definine and Call\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 stages to using functions. First you *define* a function. This is where you write the Python code and you determine the inputs and outputs and how the computation is made. This only has to be done once. \n",
    "\n",
    "After that you can *call* the function as many times as you want. When you say something like `abs(x)` you're *calling* the `abs` function. Think of functions as tools. Someone makes a hammer in a factory, someone else buys that hammer and uses it to put hundreds or thousands of nails into things-- they don't need to make a new hammer each time, it's reusable. Functions are like hammers. \n",

When you write functions, you can share your code with others, and they don't have to worry about the details of how it gets done. Python packages are just a collection of functions-- we don't need to worry about the details about how they work, but we can still use them to do cool stuff in Python! \n",

Maybe you can't think of all of them at the time you write the function. By adding `**kwargs` to your arguments, this translates to \"any number of keyword arguments\". Then the variable `kwargs` inside of your function will be a dictionary, where the key is the argument name, and the value is its value.
