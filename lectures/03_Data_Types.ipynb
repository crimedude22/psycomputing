    "> w.r.t. my previous comment - definitely would be a good idea to start this section by talking about the basic type hierarchy in python (link again: https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html). Python has a very specific notion of type/class - again, everything being an object. This unifies the explanation (as it unifies python) of later concepts like functions as being objects with a __call__ method. This is a very quick way for folks to get deep into python without becoming confusing, as they always have a rock to come back to - 'everything is an object, what I am doing is calling one of its methods.'"

It seems funny, but Python treats integers and decimals (called \"floating point\" numbers) as different types of information. This has to do with the way your computer allocates memory. Integers take up a lot less space than floats. This can matter in situations where you have thousands or millions of numbers. "
