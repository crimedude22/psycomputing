    "### What is the Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, you can interact with Python in many different ways. The \"stock\" Python interpreter is pretty limited, and makes it very difficult for using interactively. Luckily someone created IPython (<http://ipython.readthedocs.org/en/stable/overview.html>) to make it easy to use Python interactively. This interactive version can also be used in different ways (e.g., from the command line). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook sits on top of IPython, and allows you to type commands and see output directly below code \"cells\". You can make as many cells as you want. You can also interleave formatted text with your code. It is an excellent way to do data analysis and keep your work organized. "

You can end up with very long or infinite loops, and you need to interrupt the processing. You can do this through the Kernel-> Interrupt menu or clicking the stop (square) button. Kernel -> Restart resets everything, which can be useful. Each time you open a new Jupyter Notebook, it creates a new python \"kernel\", which is basically a copy of the interpreter. The terminology is weird, it's from mathematics and computer science. Think \"corn kernel\", not that *other* kind of colonel. "
