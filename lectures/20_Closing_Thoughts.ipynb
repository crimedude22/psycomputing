    "### Life Lesson: Programming is Problem Solving!\n",
    "\n",
    "I emphasized this point at the beginning of the term. Programming is not magical, and it's not really about computers, it's about *solving problems*. Programming is just a set of tools for problem-solving. I have tried to show you how to solve a wide range of problems using some of the tools that Python provides (e.g., lists, dictionaries, arrays, DataFrames). Different packages provide different tools for representing and manipulating information. Likewise, different programming languages will give you different tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "**80% of programming is deciding how to divide up your problem and represent it on the computer**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The other 20% is dealing with the peculiarities of your language (do I use brackets or parentheses? Where do the commas go?)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that there are multiple ways of solving any problem, because there are multiple ways of combinging the tools that are available. As you get more experienced, you'll notice that you'll encounter the same types of problems over and over, and the solutions will be the same. This is a challenge, separating the *structure* of your problem from the *content* of what it represents. Once you master it, programming becomes much easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other languages\n",
    "\n",
    "I encourage you to learn other languages too! [R](https://cran.r-project.org) is my favorite for doing statistics. [Matlab](www.mathworks.com) is great for signal-processing and plotting complex data. [Julia](http://julialang.org/) is a promising new language that combines the best parts of Matlab, Python, and R. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry, most of what you learned here will translate easily to other languages. In Matlab, lists are called cell arrays, and dictionaries are called structures. But they're basically the same thing! Things like looping and indexing are pretty universal, and you will encounter them in other languages. As you learn more, you'll notice more similarities \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moving Forward\n",
    "\n",
    "I know you are not experts yet, but you've gotten a taste of the tools that are available to you. Going forward, you will learn about newer tools or more sophisiticated ways of using the existing tools for solving your problems. As I mentioned above, you will get better at recognizing different types of problems, and applying particular solutions to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this class was to teach you how to read the language and to master a few of the basics. Now you can go out into the world and seek out the help you need, and the solutions you find will not be complete gibberish! Don't worry if you're still feeling confused, that's totally normal. You are all leaving this class knowing more about Python than when you started. You have already succeeded. \n",
