    "You may be unfamiliar with the way this prints out. The idea is, your folders are organized in a hierarchical structure. You have 1 big \"root\" folder, with subfolders inside of it, and subfolders inside of that. In Windows, if you click on the Start button, then \"Computer\", you can double-click on the C drive, which is the \"root\" folder of your system. But the system can have other drives, like the R drive, which we've been using for this class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On Mac, you navigate through your folders using the Finder. If you open the Finder, it might start in a different folder (like your Home folder, which matches your username). You might have a link on the left that points to the highest level. It will be something like \"Bob's Macbook Pro\". If you click on that, then you will see \"Macintosh HD\" which is your hard drive. This is the \"root\" folder for your system. Here's another trick: whatever folder you're in, you can move \"up\" in the hierarchy by pressing Cmd+[up arrow]. Just keep doing it until you see the link to the Macintosh HD. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each time you double-click on a folder name, you are moving inside of that folder, and seeing what's inside of it. This will usually be a mixture of files and other folders. You can represent your current location in this hierarchy using a **path**. It's a way to show you where you are in the system, starting from the root directory. Each folder name is separated by a slash. In Windows, this is a backslash \\, in Mac and Linux, it's a forward slash /. So, if my path is: \n",

    "On Mac, **all** paths start with the root folder / . If you connect a different hard drive, or connect to a remote drive (like you do for the class), then those are kept under the Volumes subfolder under /. When you are clicking around in the Finder, you can't see the \"Volumes\" folder, because it hides it, but it's there. \n",
