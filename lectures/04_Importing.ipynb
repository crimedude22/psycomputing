    "Stock Python is useful for a lot of things, but the beauty of Python is that you can expand its functionality by installing \"packages\". These packages are like \"apps\" for Python that allow it to do new things. There are 2 steps to using pacakges. First, they must be installed on your system so they're available (you use the command `pip install <packagename>` to do this on your own computer), then when you're writing your script, you need to tell python which package you're using. This is done with the `import` function. "
